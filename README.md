## Overview
### Description
Allows friends to create a playlist together and play vote for songs to determine which song plays next based on the number of songs it receives. The higher the votes, the higher the song moves to play next in the list of songs added.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking / Music
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer, such as tinder or other similar apps. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Analyzes users music choices added in the shared playlist, and suggests other songs that the users might wish to add to the playlist.
- **Market:** Individuals with Spotify subscriptions could use this app but could potentially allow users with other music subscriptions.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often as the user wanted depending on how often they listen to shared playlists with their friends.
- **Scope:** First I would start with allowing users to contribute to a single playlists and vote for songs in the queue and this could potentially allow users to view lyrics in sync with current song playing. Large potential to allow users with other music services such a apple music and amazon music.
